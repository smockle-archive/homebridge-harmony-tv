This project is no longer maintained. Consider trying [nicoduj/homebridge-harmony](https://github.com/nicoduj/homebridge-harmony) which, at the time of writing, is [verified](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki/Verified-Plugins) and actively maintained.

# Update 2019-09-12

**I don’t use a Logitech Harmony Hub anymore, and I’m unlikely to undertake any new development on this plugin in the near future.** For now, new patch versions will continue to be published automatically when this plugin’s depedencies are updated. Please open an issue if you are interested in maintaining this plugin.

# Use Case

The target use case of this plugin is “control a non-smart TV in HomeKit via a Harmony Hub”, not “use HomeKit as an interface for all Harmony features”. If you’d like Harmony Activites to show up as inputs in HomeKit, check out the [`homebridge-harmony` plugin](https://github.com/nicoduj/homebridge-harmony).

# Installation

Review the [Installation](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge#installation) section of the Homebridge README.

```Bash
npm install --global homebridge-harmony-tv-smockle
```

# Setup

1. Find the static IP address of your Harmony Hub. In the plugin [configuration](#Configuration), this is the `"host"` value.

2. Run `npx homebridge-harmony-tv-smockle@6.x $HOST`, if you don’t include globally-installed packages in `$PATH`) to find the unique identifier of your Harmony Hub. In the plugin [configuration](#Configuration), this is the `"remoteId"` value.

3. Run `npx homebridge-harmony-tv-smockle@6.x $HOST $REMOTE_ID`, if you don’t include globally-installed packages in `$PATH`) to find the unique identifier of the Harmony Hub-connected TV you want to control. In the plugin [configuration](#Configuration), this is the `"deviceId"` value.
